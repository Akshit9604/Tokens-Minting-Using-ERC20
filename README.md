Certainly! Below is a sample `README.md` file for a Solidity smart contract named `CustomToken`. This README provides an overview of what the contract does, how to use it, and where to find more information.

# CustomToken Contract

CustomToken is an ERC20 token smart contract written in Solidity. It extends the functionality of the standard ERC20 token with additional features such as minting, burning, and a wrapper for token transfers.

## Features

1. **ERC20 Compliance**: Implements the standard ERC20 token interface.
2. **Minting**: Allows the token owner to mint new tokens and assign them to any address.
3. **Burning**: Allows any address to burn tokens from their own balance.
4. **Transfer Wrapper**: Provides a simplified interface for transferring tokens between addresses.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Install a Solidity development environment such as [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/) or [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/).
- Ensure access to an Ethereum client for deployment, such as [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your/repo.git
   cd repo
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

### Usage

Deploy the `CustomToken` contract to a local development blockchain or a test network like Ropsten or Rinkeby.

Interact with the contract using tools like Remix, Hardhat Console, or your preferred Web3 library.

### Contract Deployment

Deploy the contract using Remix or through a script in your development environment:

- Set the `initialSupply` parameter when deploying the contract to determine the initial token supply.

### Interacting with the Contract

- **Mint Tokens**: Call the `mintTokens` function to mint new tokens and assign them to a specified address.
- **Burn Tokens**: Call the `burnTokens` function to burn a specific amount of tokens from your own balance.
- **Transfer Tokens**: Use the `transferTokens` function to transfer tokens to another address.

### Security

- Ensure that only trusted addresses have the `tokenOwner` role to prevent unauthorized minting or burning of tokens.
